# MNIST Demo

An interactive demonstration of single digit classification using deep artificial neural networks.

A web application which demonstrates the ability of both fully connected and convolutional neural networks to classify handwritten digits.

## Demonstration




## Code

### Web

The front-end is a single page web application developed with the React.js and and Redux frameworks.

### Server

The server is a python flask server which use's Google's TensorFlow library to evaluation pre-trained neural networks for handwriting recogntion.

### Neural Networks

Both the fully connnected and convolutional neural networks have been trained using TensorFlow and following the tutorials MNIST for ML beginners and Deep MNIST for Experts.
The training data used are the 60,000 training images from the MNIST database of handwritten digits.
